Node.js is a powerful and popular runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript on the server side. It uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, which makes it highly efficient for building scalable network applications. One of its key features is the module system, which allows developers to organize code into reusable pieces, including core modules, local modules, and third-party packages from npm. Node.js also supports asynchronous programming, worker threads, and environment variables, making it suitable for a wide variety of applications such as web servers, APIs, and real-time systems. With tools like npm and npx, developers can easily manage libraries and CLI packages, whether locally within a project or globally for system-wide use.
